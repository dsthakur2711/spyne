```

This architecture outlines the flow from client requests to the backend services and data layer, including static asset handling.

### Detailed Component Interactions

1. **Client (UI)**

   - Interacts with the API Gateway to perform actions.

2. **API Gateway**

   - Routes requests to appropriate controllers.
   - Applies middleware for request processing.

3. **Controllers**

   - Handle specific routes and actions.
   - Delegate business logic to services.

4. **Services**

   - Implement core business functionalities.
   - Utilize repositories for data access.

5. **Data Access Layer**

   - Manages CRUD operations and database interactions.
   - Uses ORM (Drizzle) to communicate with the database.

6. **Database**

   - Stores application data.
   - Managed and updated via migration scripts.

7. **Static Assets**
   - Serve non-dynamic content like images and stylesheets.
   - Accessible through the `public` directory.

By following this architecture, the application ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability, allowing for easier updates and feature additions.
